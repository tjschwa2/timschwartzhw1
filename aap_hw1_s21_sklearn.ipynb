    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our overall goal is to build classifier models to predict `PoliticalParty` using the the other variables. You must use sklearn Pipelines that contain your preprocessing steps and your model estimation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do your work in a Jupyter Notebook(s) or in a Python script(s) (i.e. a ``.py`` file) or both. It's up to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by creating a new project folder structure with the cookiecutter-datascience-simple template that I covered in Module 1. Put the data file into its appropriate folder and put this notebook in the main project folder. Any additional notebooks and/or Python files you end up creating should go in the main project folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Put your new project folder under version control using git. You should **NOT** track the data file. You must track any notebooks, Python scripts or additional text files you end up creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Build at least one logistic regression model (with regularization) and one random forest model to predict `PoliticalParty`. Yes, this is very similar to what we did for the Pump it Up project in Module 2. Some detailed requirements and additional information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I suggest you start by reading the csv file into a pandas dataframe. My dataframe is called ``tax_df``.\n",
    "* Then start with some basic EDA. You can certainly use automated tools such as pandas-profiling or SweetViz as I showed in the class notes. Remember, when you run either of those, you **must** have your notebook open in the classic Jupyter Notebook interface (and **NOT** in Jupyter Lab). Once you've created the EDA reports you can close your notebook and reopen in Jupyter Lab if you wish. As we've seen, the reports get created as HTML documents. These should go in your output folder within your project.\n",
    "* Since we are using regularization, all of the numeric variables should be rescaled using the `StandardScaler` - be careful, just because a variable has a numeric datatype in the pandas dataframe, it does not mean that it's necessarily a numeric variable in the context of the classification models. Think about each column and look at your EDA reports and decide whether or not it's truly numeric or needs to be treated as categorical data in the models.\n",
    "* For any variables that you decide should be treated as categorical in your models, use the `OneHotEncoder` on them in the preprocessing stage.\n",
    "* Even though our target variable, `PoliticalParty`, is categorical, you do **NOT** need to do any preprocessing on it. As I mentioned in our class notes, scikit-learn will automatically detect that and will do any encoding needed on its own (it uses the `LabelEncoder`).\n",
    "* I broke up the ``tax_df`` into two separate dataframes that I called ``X`` and ``y``, to use in the models. Here's my code for that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "X = tax_df.iloc[:, 0:9]\n",
    "y = tax_df.iloc[:, 9]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Please use the following code for your data partitioning so that we all end up with the same training and test split:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=21)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each model you fit, you should compute its ``score`` and create a confusion matrix on both train and test data. I did all of this repeatedly in the class notes.\n",
    "* For each model (the logistic regression model and the random forest) you should make some summary comments about how well the model fits and predicts and if there is evidence of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** You always should put summary comments in a markdown cell. Do **NOT** write them as comments in a code cell. The whole point of Jupyter notebooks is to be able to mix markdown cells with code cells. If you choose to do all of your Python work in a ``.py`` file(s), then simple create a Jupyter notebook in which you include your summary comments."
